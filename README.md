# Wk9-RWorkshop-Ordination_and_stuff

This week will cover some techniques in nmds ordination, environmental vectoring, species accumulation curves, permanovas, db-RDA modeling, variation partitioning, (dis)similarity analysis, and a partridge in a pear tree. Script and data file attached.

Main package being used is vegan. I'll also be using RColorBrewer and ggplot2. Other packages we might play around with if there is time that folks may want to pre-install include:
indicspecies
BiodiversityR
rareNMtests

An excellent resource for folks and where I picked up many of these techniques is this lecture (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDYPX-CutOY) that was part of an ecology series on youtube that people may want to watch if they really want a deep dive or just to save as a resource for later. Additionally, one of my go to sites for R/stats help is Gusta ME (https://sites.google.com/site/mb3gustame/), which offers straightforward explanations of the thinking behind many stats along with their ecological applications. Looking forward to sharing with everyone tomorrow!
